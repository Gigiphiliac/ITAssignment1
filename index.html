                            I'm a full on Australian. I was born in Dubbo, NSW, lived in Krasnoyarsk, Russia for a bit, and 
                            went through high school in Bega, NSW where I graduated in 2021. I speak English pretty well, and 
                            a little bit of Russian. My hobbies are mostly gaming and sport, specifically soccer and skateboarding.

                <p>
                    <h3>What is your interest in IT?</h3>My main interest in IT is the programming and troubleshooting side. Solving my own, or other people's, problems is something I quite enjoy. The satisfaction of creating solutions has motivated me to pursue this degree in the hopes of doing it as my job one day.<br>
                    <h3>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?</h3>My father is a graphic designer, my uncle is an animator, and many friends and relatives are avid gamers. Growing up with this exposure to technology got me invested in it from early. Throughout school, I had a passion for any and all STEM classes which also helped me discover and explore my interests.<br>
                    <h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>I chose to study with RMIT Online because I was searching for a technology related degree on OUA, and the only ones that really caught my interest were Bachelor of Data Science and Bachelor of Information Technology. After doing some research into the subjects in each course, I determined that the Bachelor of IT taught a wide variety of skills that could help me in whichever field I ended up wanting to pursue.<br>
                    <h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>By the end of the degree, I expect to have a solid understanding of various technological avenues. I hope the skills and knowledge accrued set me up nicely for my future career, wherever that takes me.
